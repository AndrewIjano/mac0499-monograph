\chapter{Conclusion and future work}
\label{cap:conclusion}

Different studies focused on description logics with probabilistic reasoning. In particular, finding a logic that is both tractable and expressive enough became a problem of special interest in the field.

- this work proposed a fragment of el++ with probabilistic capabilities.

- probabilistic description logics are important

- proposed solution is polynomial

- an upper bound of O() was estimated and experimental analysis confirm the polynomial complexity of the run time. 

- future work

- modeling of existential body axioms and conjunctive axioms using probabilistic restrictions

- modeling of conditional probabilities
